# BMI Calculator Flutter

This is <b>my first Flutter project</b>. I chose the <b>BMI calculator</b> as my first project. <br>
The application reacts to the selected gender and adapts its color to it.<br>
An image of a man or woman grows and shrinks depending on the chosen height.<br>
In addition, the weight is selected on a swipeable weighing scale.<br><br> 
The project uses the <b>MVP architecture</b>.<br><br> 
Additional packages used in the project were: smooth_page_indicator and flutter_svg. <bt>
The navigation between the fragments was done using PageView. <br><br> Vector images are from the website: [undraw.co](https://undraw.co/).
